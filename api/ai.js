   POST /api/ai — one route, several jobs.

   { job, payload } in, JSON out. The Anthropic key is read from
   process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY and NEVER leaves this file; nothing in src/
   knows it exists.

   Three rules this route exists to enforce:

   1. THE MODEL DOES NOT DO ARITHMETIC. Every dollar figure on a net sheet or an
      offer comparison is computed here in JS from the numbers the agent typed,
      and the model is handed the finished totals so it can only write words
      about them. A hallucinated subtotal on a client-facing net sheet is worse
      than no net sheet at all.
   2. FAIL SOFT, ALWAYS HTTP 200. No key -> {ok:false,reason:'not_configured'}.
      Malformed model output -> {ok:false,reason:'bad_json',raw} so the UI can
      say "that came back malformed, try again" instead of throwing. The only
      non-200 is a non-POST request.
   3. NO LEGAL ADVICE, NO VALUATIONS. Both are in the system prompt of every job
      that could drift into them, in the words the job actually needs.

   Parsing is defensive and never uses eval: fences stripped, JSON.parse in a
   try, one salvage attempt on the outermost {...}, then give up honestly.

   job === 'probe' answers whether the key is set without calling the model, so
   the UI can hide its Generate buttons before spending a token.
