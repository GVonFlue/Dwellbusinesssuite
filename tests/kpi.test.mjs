/* ============================================================================
   kpi — the numbers on the dashboard, the huddle, the pipeline and the
   transactions board.

   Every assertion here pins a defect that shipped once and must not ship again.
   None of it re-implements the rule: the views' own model functions are bundled
   with esbuild (their imports are extensionless for Vite, and they are JSX) and
   called directly, so a regression in the view fails here rather than in a
   realtor's Monday meeting.

   What is pinned:
     1  the "inside 48h" flag needs a LOWER bound or every overdue date is also
        "imminent"
     2  the huddle decides overdue against TODAY, not the Monday on screen, and
        never renders a negative "in N days"
     3  the weighted pipeline total sums OPEN stages only
     4  open pipeline excludes contacts that already have a transaction
     5  speed to first touch counts outbound kinds only, never the auto-note
     7  capPaidBefore() filters to the CAP PERIOD, and is deterministic for two
        deals closing the same day
    11  every funnel row counts the same unit
    18  a zero denominator is null, not 0
    20  a deal closed without a snapshot still reports its gross
    22  an appointment only counts toward a close if it happened BEFORE it
   ========================================================================== */
