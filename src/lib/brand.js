/* ============================================================
   BRAND / TENANT CONFIG
   ------------------------------------------------------------
   Everything that changes per brokerage lives here, driven by Vite
   env vars. One repo -> many Vercel projects, each with its own
   env vars pointing at its own Supabase.

   Set these in Vercel -> Project -> Settings -> Environment Variables.
   Anything not set falls back to the ProyTech defaults below,
   EXCEPT the Supabase creds, which are required on purpose so a
   misconfigured client project can never fall back to our database.

   DEMO: VITE_DEMO=1 swaps the data layer for an in-memory adapter
   (src/lib/demo.js) and no Supabase creds are needed at all.

   The product bar carries our wordmark, our product line and "built for <them>"

   wrong for one we white-label, and those are different clients, so the answer
   cannot be given once for everyone.

   It could not be given at all before this: the name was VITE_PRODUCT_SHORT, but
   the mark was hard-coded in assets.js, and val() falls back on an empty string
   so the name could be CHANGED and never REMOVED.

     name-only   product line and "built for <client>", no mark
     off         nothing — the client's own brand stands alone
